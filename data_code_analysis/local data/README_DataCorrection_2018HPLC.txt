During data handling and analysis it was discovered that the raw HPLC values of alphacarotene and betacarotene in 2018 were wrong.
We were not able to determine what happened to cause the values to be wildly off, but reasoned it was likely an accident somewhere in an excel sheet or function used for data transfer/calculation.
Nicole Waite provided me a corrected version of the dataset "AntarcticaLTERcompiledData_Cruise_forEDI_May2023.csv" (06.01.2023) with the correct values.
I am not sure when these changes will be reflected in the EDI data portal, so I have included the corrected dataset Nicole gave me here (located in the "archive" folder).
In addition, as part of the import of EDI cruise data performed during the dataset curation stage, I have included a section of code that replaces the alpha/betacarotene values in the imported EDI dataset with the corrected values extracted from the updated dataset (i.e., "DataCorrection_2018HPLC_AlphaBetaCarotenes.csv", located in "local data").

No other values in the dataset are believed to be wrong at the time of writing
